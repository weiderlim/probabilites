# Roulette Strategy Testing 

This script replicates games of roulette being played with the player's bet as the input. It allows users to test the outcomes of their bets over a large numbers of games. The outcome is the final capital size, given an initial capital size. 

This script only encompasses single, double and 4 digit bets at the moment. Other bets like 1-12, 13-24, 25-36, black vs white, has not been incorporated. 

This script was inspired to prove that a game of roulette favours the house if normal roulette rules are applied. It also shows that if the payout ratios were modified in the player's favor, final player's winnings increase drastically. It also shows that even with a large number of games played (10k in this case, but can be modified), the outcomes can vary drastically; one iteration producing massive wins for the house, the other for the player, with the same payout ratios.
